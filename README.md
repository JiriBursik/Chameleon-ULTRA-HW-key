# Chameleon-ULTRA-HW-key
The main idea behind this project is to utilize the Chameleon device not just  for RFID emulation, but as a physical security token for passwords.  The software reads the text stored in the "Nickname" or "Name" field of the  LF/HF tags within the Chameleon's slots. By saving your passwords/encryption keys, the Chameleon becomes a "Hardware Key".
